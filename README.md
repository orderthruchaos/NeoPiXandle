# NeoPiXandle


## Origins

This project is based on/forked from the ledcandle sketch found [here][led-candles-repo].

I wanted to create candle flickering for a Halloween project, and realized
that the concepts in the article [LED candles: simple, easy, cheap][led-candles-article] could be
generalized into a library.


## Pronunciation

Sounds like "neo-pick-andle".  You know...  Because cutesy names are fun.
